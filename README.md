# Micro Instagram 

Welcome to this (hopefully) collaborative tutorial on microservices. Together, we're going to explore the `why` and the `how` of implementing a web application with microservices architecture.

## Why a tutorial? 

I beleive that every open source project should be tutorialized to some extent. and offer insight into the thought processes and decisions that went into creating the software. allowing ourselves to share our ideas, learn from each other's experiences, and even grow from our mistakes. 

Going beyond implementation, contemplate about the 'why' behind every decision and step. cause after all, technology isn't just about implementation. Implementation is actually a second step, one that follows careful planning and decision-making. It's about pushing the boundaries in a direction that satisfies a specific "need" or in the case of software, a "problem".

What we are trying to do here is creating a space for all of us to learn together. learn from each others ideas as well as mistakes, and grow as a community. This shared learning journey is the magic that keeps pushing technology forward.

So, I encourage you to dive in! Explore the tutorial, play around with the code, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. If you've got ideas on how to improve the project, have any qusiton or if you find something that could be done differently, we want to hear about it. Raise an issue, contibute to the project, shoot me an email, or even shout it out loud i might just hear you! Be welcomed to our shared space!

## What are we going to make?

We're going to construct an instagram-like application to understand the principles of microservices and explore modern technologies. However, our focus isn't solely on recreating Instagram's specific functionalities. Instead, we're aiming to learn how to reason about software design.

Instagram provides a compelling, real-world example to dissect, understand, and plan. Throughout this process, we'll attempt to think like software designers, breaking down complex problems and planning their solutions.

We'll be implementing our application using technologies such as ASP.NET Core, RabbitMQ, and Docker. These tools will allow us to dive into the world of microservices and gain hands-on experience in building and deploying a modern, scalable application.

## The Why

In this section, we're going to explore the "why" behind our decision to use a microservices architecture for our Instagram-like application, as opposed to a monolithic architecture.

Before we dive into the reasons behind our decision, let's define what we mean by "microservices".

A microservices architecture is a method of developing software systems that are made up of independently modular services. Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a specific goal.

When crafting a software application, one of the critical decisions we make is the architectural style we adopt. It fundamentally influences how we organize our code, how our application scales, and how teams work together.

Choosing a microservices architecture offers us several key advantages:

1. Scalability : Microservices are independently deployable services. This means we can scale up the parts of our application that need it the most, rather than scaling the entire application.

2. Resilience : With a microservices architecture, if one service fails, the others can continue to function. This isolation reduces the risk of system-wide failures.

3. Technological Freedom : Microservices provide the flexibility to use different technologies and languages within the same application. We can choose the best technology for each service.

4. Faster Time to Market : Microservices can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, enabling faster and more frequent updates and improvements.

5. Single Responsibility : Each microservice has a specific role and fulfills a single business capability. This follows the single responsibility principle where a component of the software should have only one reason to change.

6 Loosely Coupled : Microservices are independent entities. Changes to one service should not require changes in another. This allows teams to work on different services without affecting the work of others.

7 Distributed Development  : Microservices can be developed using different programming languages and can use different data storage technologies.

8. Fault Isolation : A failure in one service does not directly affect others. This leads to better fault isolation and resilience.

9. Data Isolation : Each microservice can have its own database, which allows it to be decoupled from other services. This helps to maintain data consistency within the service.

10. Communication : Microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs and protocols, often HTTP/REST or asynchronous messaging when using an event-driven architecture.

While a monolithic architecture might seem simpler at first, as the application grows, the complexity can become a significant challenge. With microservices, we can better manage this complexity by breaking down the application into manageable, isolated components.

In the following sections, we'll delve deeper into these advantages and explore how we can leverage them to build our Instagram-like application.
