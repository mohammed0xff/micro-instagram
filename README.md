# Micro Instagram 

Welcome to this (hopefully) collaborative tutorial on microservices. Together, we're going to explore the `why` and the `how` of implementing a web application with microservices architecture.

## Why a tutorial? 

I beleive that every open source project should be tutorialized to some extent. and offer insight into the thought processes and decisions that went into creating the software. allowing ourselves to share our ideas, learn from each other's experiences, and even grow from our mistakes. 

Going beyond implementation, contemplate about the 'why' behind every decision and step. cause after all, technology isn't just about implementation. Implementation is actually a second step, one that follows careful planning and decision-making. It's about pushing the boundaries in a direction that satisfies a specific "need" or in the case of software, a "problem".

What we are trying to do here is creating a space for all of us to learn together. learn from each others ideas as well as mistakes, and grow as a community. This shared learning journey is the magic that keeps pushing technology forward.

So, I encourage you to dive in! Explore the tutorial, play around with the code, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. If you've got ideas on how to improve the project, have any qusiton or if you find something that could be done differently, we want to hear about it. Raise an issue, contibute to the project, shoot me an email, or even shout it out loud i might just hear you! Be welcomed to our shared space!
